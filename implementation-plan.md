# Implementation Plan for Fixing Vercel Deployment

## Current Issue
The deployment is failing due to a non-existent GSAP package dependency:
`@gsap/shockingly@^3.12.5`

## Analysis
- The project uses GSAP for animations and scroll effects
- Only standard GSAP features and ScrollTrigger plugin are being used
- The @gsap/shockingly package is not a valid package and is causing the deployment to fail

## Solution Steps
1. Remove the invalid dependency:
   - Remove `"@gsap/shockingly": "^3.12.5"` from package.json

2. Verify GSAP imports:
   - Confirm all GSAP features are imported from the main 'gsap' package
   - Current imports look correct in gsap-register.ts

3. Test locally:
   - Run npm install
   - Build the project
   - Verify animations still work as expected

4. Deploy to Vercel:
   - Push changes
   - Monitor deployment logs

## Expected Outcome
- Successful deployment on Vercel
- All GSAP animations continuing to function as before
